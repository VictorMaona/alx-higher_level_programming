0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

The expression "almost a circle" often describes a shape that resembles a
perfect circle in appearance but may also have very minor imperfections or
deviations from it. It can be applied in a variety of situations despite being a
rather ethereal or subjective idea.

The turtle module is used to draw a shape that resembles a circle in the
Python code sample I earlier supplied. The number of sides in the polygon
determines the degree of "almost" in this situation. The shape will resemble a
circle more closely if it has more sides.
