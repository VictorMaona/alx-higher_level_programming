0x13 JavaScript Objects, Scopes and Closures.

1. JavaScript Objects:
Key-value pairs are called objects in JavaScript, and they constitute the basic type 
of data structure.  Real-world entities can be represented as objects, which can also
capture their characteristics and actions.

2. In JavaScript, scopes:
JavaScript supports both block and function scopes. Generally speaking, variables
declared inside a function are only available inside that function (function scope). 
Block scope refers to the fact that variables defined with let and const are restricted 
to the block (between {}) in which they are declared.

3. Terminations in JavaScript:
When a function is defined inside another function, a closure is formed that permits 
the inner function to access the variables of the outer function. Closures are effective 
tools for data privacy and encapsulation.
