0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

##In Python, almost everything is an object with properties and functions.
# A class functions as a kind of "blueprint" or object constructor. Use the term class to create a class.
#We can construct objects using the class MyClass: Methods can also be found in objects. Object-specific functions are called methods in an object.
