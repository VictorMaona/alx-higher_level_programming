0x0E. SQL - More queries

A programming language called SQL, or Structured Query Language, 
was created specifically for organizing, querying, and interacting 
with relational databases. It can be used to do operations including
building, editing, and querying databases and their contents. Tables in 
SQL databases are made up of rows and columns, and SQL is used to communicate
with these tables. 

#Common SQL queries and operations are:

SELECT Query- statement is employed to get information out of a database.
INSERT Query- a table with new records by using a statement. 
UPDATE Query- a table's existing records can be changed using a statement.
DELETE Query- a table's records can be removed using a statement.
CREATE TABLE- Using a statement, a new table's columns and data types are defined.
ALTER TABLE - statement is used to add, change, or remove columns from a table 
              that already exists.
