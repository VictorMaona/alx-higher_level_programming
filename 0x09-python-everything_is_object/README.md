0x09. Python - Everything is object

#Objects are variables:
In Python, a variable is not merely a place to store a value; it is also an independent object.
This implies that variables are just like other objects in that they have properties and may be changed.

#Functions are objects: 
First-class objects in the Python programming language. Like any other object,
you can provide them as arguments to other functions, assign them to variables  and return them from functions.

#Types are objects: 
Even data types like floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, and integers are objects.
You can access and use their characteristics and methods.

#Classes are objects: 
 Classes are objects. A class is a new type of object that can be created the same way as any other object when it is defined.
