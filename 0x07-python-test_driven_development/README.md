0x07. Python - Test-driven development

A software development process called test-driven development (TDD)
emphasizes building tests before writing actual code. TDD's main objective is
to guarantee the accuracy and dependability of your code. Three steps—Red,
Green, and Refactor—make up its cycle.

#Importance of Test-Driven Development in Python:

Better Code Quality: By making you think about the design from the start, TDD pushes you to write cleaner, more modular code.

Regression Testing: Tests act as a safety net, assisting you in swiftly identifying and resolving errors when you modify your codebase.

Test cases offer executable documentation of the behavior of your code, making it simpler for others to comprehend and apply your code.

Confidence: When working on complicated or important projects, TDD can be especially important because it offers you the assurance that your code functions as intended.
