0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

The main use of JavaScript, a high-level interpreted programming language, 
is in web development. These are the main features that characterize JavaScript
and its operation.



High-level Language:

Being a high-level language, JavaScript offers abstractions that free you from 
worrying about minute details and let you concentrate on the logic of your application.

Interpreted Language:

An interpreter, often known as a JavaScript engine, runs the interpreted language 
JavaScript during runtime. A more dynamic and adaptable development process is made
possible by this.


Client-Side Scripting Language:

JavaScript is primarily utilized by web browsers as a client-side scripting language
to provide dynamic and interactive user experiences. It can run in a web browser 
and be immediately inserted into HTML.
